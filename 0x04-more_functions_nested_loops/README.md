0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
Requirements followed
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
Tasks
Task0: Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
Prototype: int _isupper(int c); Returns 1 if c is uppercase Returns 0 otherwise FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isupper. Run man isupper to learn more.

Task1: a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
Prototype: int _isdigit(int c); Returns 1 if c is a digit Returns 0 otherwise

Task2: a function that multiplies two integers. Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);
Task3: a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Task4: a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Task5: a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
Task6: a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
Task7: a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
Task8: a function that prints a square, followed by a new line
Task9: a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
Task10: a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line
Task11: a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
Task12: a function that prints an integer.
Prototype: void print_number(int n); You can only use _putchar function to print You are not allowed to use long You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers You are not allowed to hard-code special values
