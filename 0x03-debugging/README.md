0x03. C - Debugging
Requirement followed
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about
Tasks
Task0: test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
Task1: Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.

Task2: Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
Line count will not be checked for this task.

Task3: Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
Line count will not be checked for this task. You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31). You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
